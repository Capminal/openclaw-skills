# Agent Skills

A community-driven collection of skills for AI agents.

## What are Skills?

Skills are modular abilities that teach AI agents new capabilities. Each skill contains:
- `SKILL.md` - Instructions and API documentation for agents
- `_meta.json` - Skill metadata

## Installation

### Requirements

Every skill here reads its credential from the **`CAP_API_KEY` environment variable** — there is no credentials file. Before installing:

1. Generate a key at [capminal.ai/settings](https://www.capminal.ai/settings) (**API Key** tab).
2. Set `CAP_API_KEY` in the environment of the agent host (AgentOS, Claude Code, a container, an SDK runtime), then restart the agent.
3. Install [`capminal`](./capminal) first — `contract-interaction` and `morse-launch-b20` act on the Cap Wallet it sets up, and share the same key.

Each skill declares this requirement in its `SKILL.md` frontmatter, so hosts that gate on missing credentials will show it as needing setup until the variable is present.

### Manual Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Capminal/agent-skills.git
cp -r agent-skills/capminal ~/.agents/skills/
```
